# **App Name**: Aenzbi IoT Cloud

## Core Features:

- Predictive Maintenance: AI-powered Predictive Maintenance: Analyze sensor data (vibration, temperature) from construction equipment to predict maintenance needs, reducing downtime and costs. Uses an AI tool to decide when to escalate maintenance requests based on predictive failures.
- Real-time Dashboard: Real-time Monitoring Dashboard: Display live data from IoT devices in homes, hotels, offices, and construction sites. Includes customizable widgets, alerts, and reporting features.
- Device Management: Device Management: Remotely manage and configure IoT devices. Supports OTA updates, security patching, and device grouping.
- Access Control: User Access Control: Role-based access control to manage user permissions and data security, enabling different access levels for different users within each environment (home, hotel, office, construction).
- Alerting: Alerting and Notifications: Configure and receive alerts based on sensor data, such as temperature spikes, motion detection, or equipment failures, sent via SMS, email, or push notifications.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust, reliability, and technological expertise.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and professional interface.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight important data points and call-to-action buttons.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern, geometric look, best used for titles and short descriptive elements.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to pair with 'Poppins'; it combines a modern look and a little warmth, making it suitable for descriptive content.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different IoT devices and sensor types. Follow Material Design guidelines for consistency.
- Implement a responsive layout to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
